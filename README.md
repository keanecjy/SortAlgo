# Sort-Algo

Welcome to Sort-Algo, a sorting visualiser app which helps you to learn and understand sorting algorithms through interacting animations as well as explanations. <br />
<br />
We built this app as we feel that usually when learning sorting algorithms, there is a lack of visual representation, and hence would like to help future students who are learning these sorting algorithms to have a way to visualize such algorithms with step by step explanation. We hope that you enjoy learning and playing around with this visualization tool.
Check out our app [here!](https://algosort.netlify.app/)
